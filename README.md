# Reflection on My Development Process

## Process and Challenges During Development
When starting this project, I focused first on building the homepage since I felt it would be the most complex part of the website. I decided not to spend too much time on the other pages since they follow a similar structure.

At the beginning, I made the mistake of spending a lot of time on customization. I tried to adjust fonts, colors, and breakpoints before actually starting the coding process. Looking back, I realize that I should have focused on building the website first and then worked on customization later. This approach made me feel stuck and slowed my progress. I learned that it’s better to just start coding and refine things as I go.

One of the main challenges I faced was working with multiple CSS frameworks. I spent a lot of time trying to understand how to combine them and customize them to fit my needs. It took me a long time to figure out how to do this properly. However, I realized that I needed to focus more on understanding the framework I was using (Bootstrap), instead of getting distracted by trying to make everything perfect from the beginning. Once I realized this, I refocused and was able to continue with the project more efficiently.

Another issue I faced was with customizing breakpoints. I initially wanted to fix this problem right away, but I decided to finish the mobile version first and return to breakpoints later. This helped me stay focused on the bigger picture and avoid getting stuck on one small issue.

# Key Takeaways
- It’s better to start coding first and make adjustments as needed, rather than overthinking and customizing from the start.
- Effective time management is key. Spending too much time on one issue can slow down the overall progress.
- Learning the core principles of a technology helps in adapting to different tools or frameworks in the future.
- It's important to focus on the bigger picture and not get stuck on minor details, especially in the early stages of development.

Overall, this project taught me how to approach development in a more efficient and flexible way, and how to focus on solving problems without getting overwhelmed by unnecessary details. 

Thank you Rob. I will miss your class.

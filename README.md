# Day 1
## about the font&color custom

It is required that we should use more than 1 css frameworks, so I choose Tailwind at first as it is well-knowed in both China and North America. Then I did a lot of research on "How can I custom my own color and font, how can i combine the two frameworks". I spend almost 2 hour on custom Tailwind, then I realized that the point is not Tailwind. I need to figure out how can I use bootstrap, so I did the research again and redo it.

Now I have another issue: how can i custom the breakpoints. But I decide to finish my mobile version first and then think about this question.
